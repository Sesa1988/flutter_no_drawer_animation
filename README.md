# no_drawer_animation

1. flutter run --release
2. long press on card -> animation is shown
3. tap card in order to navigate to child route and navigate back
4. long press on card -> no animation

on debug its sometimes properly working sometimes not and it seems it works always on macOS, at least it seems like that after testing.
